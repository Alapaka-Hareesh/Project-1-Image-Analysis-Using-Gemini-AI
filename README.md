# Project-1-Image-Analysis-Using-Gemini-AI

**Project Description**

This project demonstrates how to integrate Google’s Gemini AI (a powerful multimodal generative AI model) with a Streamlit web application to perform image analysis tasks.

The goal of this project is to build an interactive AI-powered web app where users can upload an image and receive detailed analysis, including object detection, scene understanding, and contextual insights — all powered by Gemini’s vision capabilities.

The application serves as an example of how Generative AI and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) can be leveraged in real-world applications for computer vision and image-based reasoning tasks using a simple Python web interface.

**Objectives**

To develop a Streamlit-based interactive interface for uploading and analyzing images.

To utilize Gemini AI’s multimodal capabilities for understanding and describing images.

To provide users with detailed visual analysis, such as object recognition, scene descriptions, and insights.

To demonstrate integration between Google AI APIs and Python-based web frameworks.
